# Overview
This is a Student Database program that I have developed to To learn Java. It includes a 'delete course' feature, which I added to the original codebase. To make this work, I had to change a few things in both the StudentDatabase and Student classes. Specifically, I switched the 'courses' attribute to a list and added a 'for' loop and 'courses.add' in the 'enroll' method. These changes let students remove courses if they want.
